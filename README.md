# CYBER ATTACK PREDICTION USING ML ALGORITHMS LIKE(MLP AND RANDOM FOREST)

## üöÄ Project Overview
**CyberAttack Predition** is a machine learning-based system designed to detect and predict cyber threats using two powerful classification algorithms ‚Äî **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** and **Random Forest**. The goal is to provide a robust, intelligent detection mechanism that classifies network behaviors as either safe or potentially malicious.
This project includes a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter that allows users to run the models, evaluate performance, and visualize comparative results.

## üìå Features
- Preprocessing of dataset for optimal model performance
- Implementation of **Random Forest** for efficient, ensemble-based classification
- Implementation of **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)** for deep learning-based detection
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction
- Performance comparison of both models via accuracy and visualization

## üß† Machine Learning Algorithms Used
### 1. Random Forest
- Ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees
- Excellent for handling high-dimensional datasets
- Less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees
### 2. MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)
- Feedforward neural network with one or more hidden layers
- Learns complex nonlinear patterns in data
- Suitable for large-scale classification tasks

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python 3.7.0**
- **Tkinter** for GUI
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** for data handling
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualization
